# B1 Scraper

## To run the application:

1. Clone it using GitHub link.
2. Run "npm install"
3. Then run "npm start", I hardcoded the first URL "https://courselab.lnu.se/scraper-site-1" in the index.js file. You can run it with the the starting URL as a parameter just like "npm start https://courselab.lnu.se/scraper-site-2".
